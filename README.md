# Battery-Optimiser

This repository contains the final code and results for my group capstone uni course. I specifically worked on the optimizer_module.py, the cleaning_test_data.py, the testing environment including generate_results_data.py and combined the testing environment, my optimizer and my teams machine learning algorithm to generate the raw results which can be found in the FINAL_RESULTS_DATA and visualised important results which can be seen in the png files. I have also uploaded the final report that we were graded on, receiving an overall HD grade.

Abstract

The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has recently implemented
the use of new battery storage systems as a contribution to the movement towards renewable energy. Having a relationship between batteries and other sources
of renewable energy generation, predominantly solar and wind, allows energy to
be discharged at times of peak high demand and stored during times of low demand. Predictions of energy demand and energy market prices are needed to
maximise the profits of using such a system. Profits are defined as the revenue
obtained from discharging energy in moments of high energy demand and the
costs of charging the battery when there is low demand. The aim of this report
is to produce a forecasting model that generates accurate predictions of energy
prices in the South Australian region which can then be linearly optimised to
maximise the profit of a battery over a 6-month period. The results of the optimisation model are promising as 44.54% of the maximum attainable profit available
in the market was achieved by the model.
